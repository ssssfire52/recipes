Peter's Easy Bread
Total Time: 3 hours, 45 minutes

Ingredients:
3/4 cup warm water
1 package active dry yeast
1 tsp salt
1-1/2 tbsp sugar
1 tbsp vegetable shortening
1/2 cup milk
3 cups all-purpose flour, approximately

Preparation:
In large bowl, add the warm water. Slowly stir in dry yeast. Continue to stir 
until yeast is dissolved.

Add salt, sugar, shortening, and milk to bowl. Stir.

Mix in the first 2 cups of flour.

If needed, begin adding more flour, one tablespoon at a time, until the dough 
chases the spoon around the bowl.

You do not need to use up all the flour called for in this recipe, or you may 
need more flour than called for. The amounts vary depending on many factors, 
including weather, which is why most bread recipes only give an approximate amount 
of flour needed.

Turn dough out onto floured board and knead, adding small spoonfuls of flour as 
needed, until the dough is soft and smooth, not sticky to the touch.

Put dough in buttered bowl, turn dough over so that the top of dough is greased. 
Cover and let rise in warm spot for 1 hour.

Punch down dough. Turn out onto floured board and knead.

Preheat oven at 375 degrees F. 

Form dough into loaf and set in buttered bread pan. Cover and let rise for about 
30 minutes.

Score dough by cutting three slashes across the top with a sharp knife. Put in 
oven and bake for about 45 minutes or until golden brown.

Turn out bread and let cool on a rack or clean dishtowel.
